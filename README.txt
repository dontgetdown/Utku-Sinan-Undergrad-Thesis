######SIMULATION MODEL
The main program is Final_v3.py and some of functions stand as a module in functions.py file. The program takes a video as input which is test_input.mp4. It recognizes the cars and the lines on the road. There is another test input named as test_input2.mp4.

#####DEMONSTRATION MODEL
This section was paused since the camera module were damaged because of the camera mount. 
Nevertheless the motors can be controlled with Raspberry Pi and a demonstration video can be found whose name is Demo.mp4 in the project file. The car moves depending on the arrow keys on the keyboard. In the video it is also shown which keys were presssed during the test.
